Ansible's dry run feature enables users to execute a playbook without making changes to the servers. It uses the built-in check mode to proof a playbook for errors 
before execution. This option is very useful when executing complex playbooks that contain commands which make major changes to servers.


command:
ansible-playbook --check --diff main.yml

Check mode is just a simulation, and if you have steps that use conditionals that depend on the results of prior commands, it may be less useful for you.
However it is great for one-node-at-time basic configuration management use cases.
